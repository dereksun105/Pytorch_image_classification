# Pytorch_image_classification

Create Neural Networks in the Deep Learning Framework PyTorch. 

## Building a Neural Network in Pytorch

### add the Convolutional Layers & Linear Layers
We will then look at how to add optimizer and train the model. Finally, we will test and evaluate our model on test data.
